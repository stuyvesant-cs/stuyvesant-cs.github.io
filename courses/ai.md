The one-semester Artificial Intelligence course introduces a series of technical AI topics, including smart searching of large data spaces, game-analysis and game-playing strategies, information theory and machine-learning with decision trees.  Two thirds of the course will be dedicated to technical topics, and one third will cover non-programming topics such as news of significant advances in AI.  A large variety of socio-economic issues surrounding AI will also be discussed such as, privacy/surveillance, automation of cognitive jobs, military uses, large data and informational inequality.

AP Computer Science is a prerequisite for Artificial Intelligence.
