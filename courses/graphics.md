Over the course of the semester, students in Computer Graphics will write their own graphics engine, starting with line encoded and ending with lighting, shading and animation. The course is built around devising, writing and using the algorithms that are key to computer graphics. The class is not taught in any specific language because it is focused on the algorithms that students can choose to implement in a language of their choosing. Resources will be provided in C and Python.

AP Computer Science is a prerequisite for Computer Graphics.
