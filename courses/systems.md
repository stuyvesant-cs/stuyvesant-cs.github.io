Systems Level Programming covers the C programming language and development in a linux environment. Over the course of the semester students will learn how to control the main components of a computer (memory, storage, input/output, processor) at a low level. Over the course of the semester students will write a terminal shell as well as network server and client programs.

AP Computer Science is a prerequisite for Systems Level Programming.
