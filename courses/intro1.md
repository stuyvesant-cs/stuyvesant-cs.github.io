Stuyvesant's first semester of computer science introduces students to many major concepts in the field all while learning how to program. The course is split between Racket (formerly Scheme) and NetLogo. Students are given a strong foundation in computer science including an introduction to more advanced topics like recursion, state machines and cellular automata. The course culminates in a final project written in NetLogo.

Stuyvesant's second semester of computer science moves deeper into the field while continuing to work on programming assignments. Students will create program driven webpages, and learn about data analysis. The course is primarily taught in Python, along with HTML and a bit of review of Racket and NetLogo.
