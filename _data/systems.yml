      - info: Mac OSX is built off of a linux style base system (BSD Unix), which makes compiling and running source for linux programs easier on the mac without having to install Ubuntu. Note that there are some differences between the OSX system libraries and the linux ones. Usually, the OSX compiler is less forgiving the the Ubuntu one.
      - info: If you have OSX version 10.6 or later, you should be able to use the Mac App Store to find Xcode and install it for free.
      - info: "You will need to install the command line tools after Xcode installs, this is easy, just open a terminal and enter: $ xcode-select --install"
