The following criteria will be used in determining the grade a student earns in Computer Science Classes:


| Criteria                     | Weight     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
|  Exams, Quizzes and Projects | 75% - 80%  |
|  Homework                    | 5% - 20%   |
|  Class Participation         | up to 15%  |
|  Lab Work                    | up to 15%  |

* Individual teachers may announce more precise percentage limits in class.
* A minimum of two announced full period exams or their equivalent will be given each marking period.

* Projects are multi day assignments where students will be expected to develop both at home and in class. They can be weighted as an exam.
* Mini projects are projects of a short duration (two to three days). They can be weighted at up to 20% of one exam.
* Lab work includes time allotted to work on assigned projects in the computer lab
* Students who are medically excused (absent) on test days must have their parent call the school switchboard at (212) 312-4800 (after 8:00 AM) to leave a message for the students teacher informing them of their child's illness. Parents are asked to leave a contact phone number for verification.
